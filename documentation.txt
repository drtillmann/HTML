Daniel Tillmann worked on the design and layout of all four pages.

The "valid" icon in the top right hand corner derived from the W3C website and the source code was copied from there.

The website logo was downloaded from http://nowgoplay.com/clip_art/sports/golf_courseclipart.html. The favicon was created from the logo image and was done so at
http://www.favicon.co.uk/.

The image (Golf Hawaii.jpg) on the home page (index.htm) was downloaded from http://www.dwalls.com/Nature/Hawaii/Golf+Hawaii.jpg.html?g2_imageViewsIndex=1

The images for the products (drivers, irons and putters) all derived from http://shop.callawaygolf.com/?gcid=g201.

The Guest to the site enters the homepage and is prompted to enter a password. If the password matches he is signed in as the ID befor him.
If the passwords do not match he is prompted to enter a new username. The username is written to the homepage inside the links div box.
After signing in the guest can then choose wich page to jump to, either drivers, irons or putters. Each page has a form for the guest to choose which item
he wants to order, how many, where to ship them and how to pay for them. There is a submit button to send the information and a clear button which sets the form 
elements empty.
